# compli
Android App to remind people to give compliments  
> [download it from the google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.noelfriedrich.compli)

The App contains a timer telling you how long it's been since you've given someone a compliment. If you give a compliment to someone, you can reset this timer. Once this timer reaches a configurable threshold, you get a reminding notification to compliment someone.  
It's a really simple app that's designed to keep people happy.
